I am now pursuing my master's degree of [Computer Science at University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). <img src='./images/ucsd_cse.png' style='width: 5em;'> Before admitted to UCSD, I graduated from [School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/NEU_CSE.png' style='width: 2em;'> with a bachelor's degree and as an exchange student, attended classes and engaged in scientific research at University of California, Irvine for one year. 

During the study at Northeastern University, I won the [Baosteel Outstanding Student Scholarship](Scholarships/宝.jpg) (Top 0.02%, National level) and the [National Scholarships](Scholarships/19国奖.png) for twice (Top 1%), which are two of the most valuable Chinese higher education scholarships. Besides, I also achieved the honor of being named as [Outstanding Graduates of Liaoning Province](awards/省优秀毕业生.jpg) (Top 2%, Provincial level) and [Outstanding College Students of Shenyang City](awards/沈优.png) (Top 1%, Municipal level).

In college, I have participated in many collegiate competitions and won nearly 20 competition awards, among which are mathematical modeling competitions, programming contests, and innovation and entrepreneurship competitions.

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD.
