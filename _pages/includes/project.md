[**Aided Alzheimer’s Diagnosis System**](https://github.com/EnmingGuo/UCI_EECS_101) 

- Designed Aided Alzheimer’s Diagnosis System based on evolving graph neural network.
- Utilized [DPARSF](http://rfmri.org/DPARSF) toolkit to finish preprocessing on fMRIs from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and MATLAB to construct dynamic brain network.
- Constructed E-GraphSage and E-GCN models as classifications via Pytorch geometric libs.
- Utilized [ttkbootstrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libs as frontend design and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) frame as backend design.
- Completed my bachelor’s degree graduation thesis (in English) "[**Design and Implementation of Aided Diagnosis System of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Evolving Graph Neural Network**](publications/论文.pdf)".

[**Imitative Linux File System**](https://github.com/EnmingGuo/NEU_File_Operating_System) 

- Designed disk external storage, partitioned disk blocks, designed file storage mode, and used Group Link algorithm to allocate free disk blocks.
- Developed comprehensive function points, including cascade create, cascade delete, copy, cut, soft link and hard link.
- Implemented the interaction based on imitative Linux query language and the parsing process of complex query functions.
