**Aided Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis System** \\
[**Project**](https://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech/) 

- Designed Aided Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis System based on evolving graph neural network.
- Utilized [DPARSF](http://rfmri.org/DPARSF) toolkit to finish preprocessing on fMRIs from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and MATLAB to construct dynamic brain network.
- Constructed E-GraphSage and E-GCN models as classifications via Pytorch geometric libs.
- Utilized [ttkbootstrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libs as frontend design and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) frame as backend design.
- Completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree graduation thesis (in English) "[**Design and Implementation of Aided Diagnosis System of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Based on Evolving Graph Neural Network**](publications/ËÆ∫Êñá.pdf)".
