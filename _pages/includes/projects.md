[**Aided Alzheimerâ€™s Diagnosis System**](https://github.com/EnmingGuo/AAD_System) 

- Designed Aided Alzheimerâ€™s Diagnosis System based on evolving graph neural network.
- Utilized [DPARSF](http://rfmri.org/DPARSF) toolkit to finish preprocessing on fMRIs from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and MATLAB to construct dynamic brain network.
- Constructed E-GraphSage and E-GCN models as classifications via Pytorch geometric libs.
- Utilized [ttkbootstrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libs as frontend design and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) frame as backend design.
- Completed my bachelorâ€™s degree graduation thesis (in English) "[**Design and Implementation of Aided Diagnosis System of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Based on Evolving Graph Neural Network**](publications/è®ºæ–‡.pdf)".

[**Database Management System**](https://github.com/EnmingGuo/Database_Management_System) 

- Implemented a Relational Database System in C++ supporting records operations; database catalog and schema update; indexing and querying. Tested with over 100000 records/operation that finished in 60 seconds.
- Developed a paged-file manager using a Heap file structure with slot directory for efficient variable length records management. Achieved O(1) record access through optimized slot indexing.
- Developed an index manager using B+ Tree for indexing and conditional scanning on various attributes, optimizing queries, insertions, and deletions. Achieved logarithmic time complexity, resulting in a 60% reduction in query response time and a 30% improvement in data insertion speed compared to linear search methods.
- Devised a query engine that supports filter, aggregation, block/index nested-loop join and grace hash join.

[**Imitative Linux File System**](https://github.com/EnmingGuo/NEU_File_Operating_System) 

- Designed disk external storage, partitioned disk blocks, designed file storage mode, and used Group Link algorithm to allocate free disk blocks.
- Developed comprehensive function points, including cascade create, cascade delete, copy, cut, soft link and hard link.
- Implemented the interaction based on imitative Linux query language and the parsing process of complex query functions.
